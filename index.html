<h1> The Flying Spaghetti Monster Lens</h1>

<p> This project is about interpreting multiple-image lens systems,
and then modelling them, based on an idea put forward by
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...310..568B">
Roger Blandford and Ramesh Narayan in 1986.</a>  At the time, only a
handful of lenses were known, so their idea was very prescient. </p>

<h2> The Blandford-Narayan classification system </h2>

<p> From Fermat's principle, light takes paths that make the travel
time a minimum, maximum or saddle point.  The Blandford-Narayan
classification involves identifying these on the sky.  Now,
topographically, there are only so many ways of arranging minima,
maxima and saddle points.  So, classification involves thinking
through a limited number of possibilities. </p>

<p> Note that BN86 is a physical classification system, with no
ambiguities.  For any multiple-image system, there is a correct
answer, which nature has chosen.  Our job is to work out that
answer. </p>

<p> To see how it works, let's first consider an ordinary topographic
example. As a first approximation, let is picture the Irchel campus as
a kind of large-scale bowl.  But within the bowl, there is structure.
To the west, there is a double pond, which is a pair of local minima.
The pathway in between has a saddle point.  The tallest building on
campus is naturally a maximum, but only a local maximum, as the
surrounding hills are far higher.  From geometry, there must be
another saddle point. </p>

<p> The schematic here shows the extremal points: maximum in yellow,
minima in red, and saddle points in magenta.  The white curves are
equal-elevation contours joining the saddle points, the <i>saddle
point contours.</i>  (The small white dots no physical significance,
they are for the user interface of an interactive tool.)  </p>

<p> The saddle-point contours are special, and they always have one of
the two topological forms shown here.  All other equal-elevation
contours are simple loops.  The saddle-point contours also
automatically identify the maxima and minima.  The two type of white
curves are the essense of the BN86 scheme.  Basically, once you can
sketch them, you are done. </p>

<p> In gravitational lenses, the yellow points correspond to mass
clumps, which are naturally maxima of the light-travel time.  One
rarely sees images there, because galaxy light from the lens itself
nearly always drowns out the lensed image.  The red and magenta dots
are the lensed images. </p>

<p> Point-like sources (that is quasars) produce the cleanest lensed
systems.  But most lensed sources are extended.  Hence the lensed
imaged are spread out into arcs.  For very large sources, one has to
think of them as multi-component sources, each with its own image
system. </p>

<h3> Some complicated examples </h3>

<p> Although there are only two building blocks in the BN86 system,
you can nest them as deeply as you like.  Here are two examples with
interesting heirarchical structure. </p>

<p> As you can see, the identification of a lensed system at this
level of complexity merits a paper in the <i>Astrophysical
Journal.</i>

<h2> Lens modelling based on the Blandford-Narayan system </h2>

<p> Once a human has provided a guess for the correct classification,
the FSMlens software will attempt to make models for the lens. </p>
